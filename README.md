### Tianle Xu (xtlsoft)

#### Basics

Currently in Jiangsu, China. Senior 2 student.

Using GitHub for developing open-source softwares. Private repos are on self-hosted services.

#### Projects

Projects currently actively working on:

- Project resix (<https://resix.run>) and sub-projects
- small libraries in my personal account

Note that despite the small libraries aren't updated recently, it does not mean they are abandoned, but they do not need to be updated. When found bugs, feel easy to open issues and I will look into them.
