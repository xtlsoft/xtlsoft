### Tianle Xu (xtlsoft)

#### Basics

Currently in College of Engineering, Peking University. Undergraduate student, major in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.

Using GitHub for developing open-source softwares. Private repos are on self-hosted services.

#### Projects

Projects currently actively working on:

- Several lab projects (Some of the source codes have not been released)
- Projects for LCPU (Linux Club of Peking University)
- small libraries in my personal account

Note that despite the small libraries are not updated recently, it does not mean that they are abandoned. The reason is that they may not need to be updated at the current stage. When bugs are found or here is a feature request, feel easy to open issues or pull requests.
